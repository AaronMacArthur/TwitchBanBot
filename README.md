# TwitchBanBot
This bot allows streamers to add viewers to a SQLServer and then mass ban them. This bot can be shared between many channels and allows for a shared ban list.
This was really created purely for the NoPixel/GTARP/RDR2RP community but its really helpful in most streaming communities. 
Setup

1. Create a bot through the Twitch Development portal
2. Make sure to get the IRC token. There are good youtube videos on it.
3. Setup the .env file, put in all relevent information
4. Setup the SQL server, create a DB and then create a list called USERS with only one column named USERS
5. Put the relevent information into the PY script

You then should be good to go. Reach out to me on Discord if you have any issues. TwitchIO is updated regularly so if it breaks then I will try to fix asap. 

If not, you can always fork a fix :)
